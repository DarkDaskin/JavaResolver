JavaResolver
============

JavaResolver is a Java class file inspection library allowing .NET programmers to read, modify and write Java class files. The library allows for low level access of the `.class` file format, but there are plans to support higher-level representations as well.

JavaResolver is released under the MIT license.

- Create, read and edit any `.class` file using the `JavaClassFile` class.
- Inspect and edit the constant pool.
- Add, inspect, edit and remove members such as methods, fields and attributes.
- Disassemble and assemble bytecode of methods (or arbitrary byte arrays).
